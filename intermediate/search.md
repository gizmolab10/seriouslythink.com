# Search

## Gosh, I forgot where that is…

If Seriously is working for you as well as expected, you may become unable to remember where everything is. Search can help you with this. Simply **tap the F key**, to reveal the search bar at the top of the app. Type carefully a word or phrase, then **tap the RETURN key**. The map will disappear revealing a list of ideas containing a match to your search. Use the vertical arrows to move through this list. When the idea you want is selected, **tap the RIGHT ARROW key**. The map will reappear displaying your chosen idea as the focus.

## Wait! I mistyped

Seriously helps you here by remembering your search request. Simply **tap the F key**, again, and then **tap the RETURN key**. The map will again disappear and the same list will be revealed.

## Nothing in the list matches what I want

You can dismiss the list and search bar by **tapping the ESCAPE key** or by **holding down the COMMAND key and tapping the F key** or by **tapping the LEFT arrow key**.

You can **tap the F or the TAB key** to return to the search bar, with your search text highlighted, making it easy for you to type something else.

## Limitations

Search will not match partial words nor misspelled words. Sorry about that.
