# A Quick Introduction

Here’s a breakdown of the tow main views in the [[../|seriously]] app: **Graph** on the right and [[details]] at the upper left.

The **Graph** view is the heart of [[../|seriously]]. The graph shows your _current_ [[focus]] and favorites shows previous focuses in case you wish return to them. Each graph is built of two things: _Ideas_ and the curved _Lines_ that connect them into a hierarchy.

At the top left, a pop up of several views provide [[details]] about what you see and preferences you can configure. Click on the title bar of each to reveal or hide its content.

An Idea

Each idea is built of three things (see figure, above): **text** in the middle and [[dots]] before and after. To [[edit]] the text, click or double click on it, or click and drag; or you can select the idea (more on this shortly) and then **tap the RETURN key** to begin or end editing. While [[edit|editing]], the arrow keys and some commands will work.

**Hold down the OPTION and COMMAND keys and tap the / key**, to see the K_eyboard Cheat Sheet_ for an up-to-date list of all the available key combinations and what they do. It contains many links to more information.
