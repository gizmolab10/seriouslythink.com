# A Quick Introduction

Here’s a breakdown of the three main views in the [[../|seriously]] app: **Graph** on the right, [**Favorites**](https://medium.com/@sand_74696/focusing-your-thinking-a53adb16bba) at the bottom left and [**Details**](https://medium.com/@sand_74696/help-inspector-view-c360241147f2) at the upper left.

The **Graph** and **Favorites** views are the heart of [[../|seriously]]. The graph shows your _current_ [[focus]] [_focus_](https://medium.com/@sand_74696/focusing-your-thinking-a53adb16bba) and favorites shows previous focuses in case you wish return to them. Each graph is built of two things: _Ideas_ and the curved _Lines_ that connect them into a hierarchy.

At the top left, two pop up views provide [**Information**](https://medium.com/@sand_74696/help-inspector-view-c360241147f2) about what you see and [**Preferences**](https://medium.com/@sand_74696/help-inspector-view-c360241147f2) you can configure. Click on the title bar of each to pop it up or down.

Each idea is built of three things (see figure, above): **text** in the middle and [**dots**](https://medium.com/@sand_74696/dots-and-a-visual-language-fdf1a14fb05c) before and after. To [edit](https://medium.com/@sand_74696/edit-d05d18996df7) the text, click or double click on it, or click and drag; or you can select the idea (more on this shortly) and then **tap the RETURN key** to begin or end editing. While [editing](https://medium.com/@sand_74696/edit-d05d18996df7), the arrow keys and some commands will work.

**Hold down the OPTION and COMMAND keys and tap the / key**, to see the K_eyboard Cheat Sheet_ for an up-to-date list of all the available key combinations and what they do. It contains many links to more information.
