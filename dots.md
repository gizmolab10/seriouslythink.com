# Dots have visual information

## **Drag dot**

The dot on the left of the text is for for **_selecting_** an idea, and for **_dragging_** it around. To indicate that an idea is selected, the color of the dot is filled in (as in the illustration below).

You can **_browse_** the graph by using the arrow keys. This changes the selecetion.

To **_move an idea_**, select it and then hold the OPTION key down as you use the arrows. You can also click on the dot and drag it.

This dot is sometimes decorated with a line or a tiny dot. A **_vertical line_** means that this idea is not writable except by the person who originally created it; this means you cannot change it’s text, nor add or remove _child ideas_. A **_tiny dot_** means that you can add _child ideas_ to it, but not edit it. No decoration means you can do both (edit it and add a _child idea_)_._

A read-only idea with two hidden children

## **Reveal dot**

When the dot on the right-side is visible, click on it to **reveal** and hide subordinate child ideas. When an idea has no children, this dot will not appear. Hidden children is indicated by inverting the color, as above.

When this dot contains a little dot at its center, it is a bookmark or a hyper-text link. If you click on a bookmark’s reveal dot, your graph will refocus at the idea from which the bookmark originated. If you click on a hyper-text link’s reveal dot, a web browser will open showing you the content of the hyper-text link.

Around this dot may appear **_tiny dots_** (e.g., the two tiny dots around the reveal dot, in the figure above). These tell you how many children will be revealed when you click it. No dots means only one child.

The tiny-dots feature is enabled

This tiny-dots feature is enabled by choosing “dots” from the “counts of subordinate ideas show as” Preference in the [[details]] view (see figure, above). In books on communicating information, a rule of thumb: visual cues count, too. Use this selector to discover which cues you like best.
