# Information and Preferences

Three panes give you information and control over your graph. The **_Information_** describes the size of your graph and at what level within it you are currently focused. It also shows you how many cloud operations are queued up for processing.

The **_Preferences_** pop up view

The **_Preferences_** pop up view (shown at left) lets you alter general and specific aspects like line thickness or color of an idea.

The choice between _precede_ and _follow_ lets you tell Thoughtful whether a new idea will appear above or below your current one, or at the top or bottom of the list of child ideas.

**NOTE**: This choice can also be invoked by tapping the period key, which will toggle between these two options.
