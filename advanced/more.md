# Color, Marks and Other Extras

Thoughtful is about ideas you wish to review and use later, some extra features are available to make this more pleasant and less tedious.

## Color

Color draws the eye and makes things look less plain, so Thoughtful provides two ways to introduce color into your graph. Select an idea and open the [Preferences](https://medium.com/@sand_74696/help-inspector-view-c360241147f2) view and, in the colors panel (shown below), click on the color well labeled “ideas.” Notice as you change the choice of color in the color wheel or palette, the dots and curved lines instantly change to that color. All subordinated ideas will be similarly affected, providing a subtle and pleasant indication of association within the group.

The text color remains black. To make the text color match the dots and curved lines, **tap the I key**. This same key will turn the text color black.

## Marks

Another way to draw attention to a single idea is to mark it. This places a mark character surrounded by parentheses at the front of your idea. The following figure shows the full list of marker characters:

For example, to mark something as done, you might **tap the X key**. Your idea will be moved into the nearest done idea (or one will be created):

You may want to mark your idea with numbers that increment by one. Select the ideas you wish to enumerate in this way and **tap the HASH [#] key**.

## Email

Thoughtful provides you the ability to remember an email address and to automatically open the Mail app with an empty email with that address. To add an email to an idea, selected it and **tap the H key and then the E key**. Your idea will look like the figure below. Notice three things: (1) the idea is in editing mode, (2) the entire text is selected, allowing you to immediately begin entering the address, (3) the reveal dot contains a tiny “e” indicating the idea contains an email address. When you finish typing the address, **tap the RETURN key** to finish and automatically send it to the cloud. Note that the tiny “e” remains. To open an email, simply **tap the = key**.

## Hyperlinks

To save a hyperlink which points to a web page you want Thoughtful to remember and invoke for you later, simply **tap the H key twice** on the idea you wish to save it in. Like emails above, this immediately lets you begin entering the hyperlink, and is indicated with a tiny “h” inside the reveal dot. To invoke this link, simply **tap the = key**.
