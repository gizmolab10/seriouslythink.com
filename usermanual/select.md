# Selecting Ideas

In your graph at least one idea is always selected. This is indicated by the outline encircling it.

## Focus

By default, the [focus](https://medium.com/@sand_74696/focusing-your-thinking-a53adb16bba) (left-most idea) is selected. Furthermore, no matter which idea is selected, if you click on the background, the focus will be selected.

## Browse

The ARROW keys browse the graph. For example, when you **tap the UP ARROW**, the selection circle will encircle the idea immediately above. However, if your selected idea is already at the tip, the selection will wrap (move to the bottom). **Tapping the DOWN ARROW** will wrap at hte bottom.

If you **tap the RIGHT ARROW**, the subordinate ideas will automatically be revealed. This auto-reveal also happens when you **tap the LEFT ARROW** when the focus is selected.

If you **hold the COMMAND key down** while using any of these **ARROW** **keys**, the selection will shift to the extreme in the arrow’s direction.
