# Parent / Child Tweaks

Sometimes a subordinate [child] idea may seem more inclusive than its parent. With a single command you can swap them. Select the subordinate idea …

**Tap T again** to restore the original relationship.

Sometimes the subordinate idea adds an unnecessary level. You can combine it with its parent with a single command. Again, select the subordinate idea, **hold the COMMAND key down and tap the D key**. The combined idea will begin editing with the former subordinate text selected.

Sometimes part of an idea makes more sense subordinated. To do this, select that part, as in “combined,” immediately above, **hold the COMMAND key down and tap the D key**. The new subordinate idea will show as bing edited with all text selected.

**Hold the COMMAND key down and tap the D key, again**, to restore the former set of ideas (“combined”) and editing state.
